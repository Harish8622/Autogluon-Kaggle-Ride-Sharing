# üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è AutoGluon-Kaggle-Ride-Sharing  

This project predicts **bike rental demand** using **AutoGluon**, as part of the **Kaggle Bike Sharing Demand competition**.  
It explores **feature engineering, model tuning, and hyperparameter optimization** to improve RMSE scores.

## üìå Project Overview  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Analyze dataset trends and visualize distributions.  
- Identify **seasonal patterns, temperature effects, and peak demand hours**.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Baseline Model with AutoGluon**  
- Train an **initial `TabularPredictor` model** with default settings.  
- Submit predictions to **Kaggle** as a **benchmark score**.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering & Model Improvement**  
- Extract additional features to enhance model accuracy:  
  - `hour`, `is_rush_hour`, `weekday`, `temperature_interaction`  
- Train an updated model and compare performance.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO)**  
- Tune **key hyperparameters** for better model performance:  
  - `num_boost_round`, `learning_rate`, `max_depth`  
- Evaluate optimized models **vs. baseline performance**.  

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Final Evaluation & Findings**  
- Compare **feature engineering vs. hyperparameter tuning** impact.  
- Identify the **best strategy** for improving AutoGluon models.  

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Metric**  
- Using **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** to evaluate model effectiveness and the impacts of the feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
