# Autogluon-Kaggle-Ride-Sharing

In this project, I use Autogluon to predict ride sharing demand and submit the results as part of the Bike Sharing Demand Kaggle competition. The project will be based on the dataset available from there
- I start by performing some EDA to understand the dataset
- I then use AutoGluon's TabularPredictor with its standard settings to obtain some baseline models and submit this score to Kaggle as a baseline score.
- I then revist the EDA to perform feature engineering and explore how this can improve the Kaggle score
- I perform some hyperparameter tuning to explore how this can futher improve the Kaggle score
- Finally, I will reflect upon the findings of this project and evaluate the most effective way of improving the performance of a model created with AutoGluon

- Throughout this project, I will use RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to evaluate the models performance and to understand the impacts of feature engineering and hyperparameter optimisation
